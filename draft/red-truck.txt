It has been confirmed that late on the
night of the sixth of July, a large red
truck ran into the bakery on Maryland
Street. After an initial investigation by
police, it is now clear that the truck had
no driver at all. The locals are asking a
simple question: "Where was the
driver?" If the police want to solve this
mystery, they will need the CCTV
footage from the street. One of the
locals said: "We're all quite
worried about a truck with no driver. This truck has never been seen in the
neighbourhood before. If we'd seen that truck before, we'd solve this mystery now."
Many locals share the same concerns. They want to know what's happening in their
town.
A witness at the crime scene told police: "There was a loud noise coming from the
truck while it was going towards the building and its speed.... it was unbelievable. If it
had been going slower, I would've had a chance to see the driver. But all I saw was
the truck speeding into the bakery as fast as it could."
The police have already spoken with eleven other residents but no one knows any
further details about the incident. Superintendent Amanda Slippers remarked: "This
is a tough case. The truck licence plate belongs to this town, but nobody has seen it
here. According to the town records, the owner of the truck moved away from here
years ago. No one knows where to. If we located the owner, we'd probably solve this
mystery."
If a truck moves, then it has a driver. Well, maybe we should change this basic
assumption on account of this mysterious red truck.
