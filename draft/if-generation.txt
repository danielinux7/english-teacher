THE IF GENERATION
Nowadays, many people have issues with appreciating what they have; it is always the
matter of 'If I were richer…', 'If I were younger…', 'If I were him…' etc. I don't have a problem
with the fact that we want more from our lives; what annoys me is the fact that we keep
saying what we would do 'IF' …
When I was younger, I thought that if my parents had been richer I could have been more
fortunate with my life. I was losing my time on thinking that if I had been born in the family of
my cousin, I would have enjoyed private tennis lessons, skiing holidays in Austria or
expensive, fashionable clothes. What I didn't take into consideration back then was the fact
that I didn't really like sport, I absolutely hated skiing and expensive clothes often covered
the lack of personality. In other words, I was jealous of the things that I didn't want in reality.
Nowadays I keep finding myself the new 'ifs' that can successfully keep me away from being
happy. I think that if I had more time, I would start going to the gym; if I had more money, I
would eat healthy etc. Result? An overweight 30-year-old woman, always complaining about
how difficult life is.
But the problem of 'ifs' doesn't finish here. We tend to overuse the 1st conditional in quite
straightforward situations. 'I'll visit you if I have time' usually means 'I won't visit you, I'm
busy' or 'I will lend you the money if I can' equals: ' I will not lend you the money, don't put
me in an uncomfortable situation'. Why do we choose to send confusing messages when we
can simply say what we think? We have to be not only politically correct anymore, we must
be socially correct too.
